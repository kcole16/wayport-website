        <p class="legal-effective">Effective Date: February 17, 2026</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes the types of information gathered by Wayport Inc ("Wayport", "us" or "we") in the process of providing www.wayport.tech and the data, services, information, tools, functionality, updates and similar materials (collectively, the "Website"), how we use the information, with whom the information may be shared, what choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of information, and our efforts to protect the information you provide to us through the Website.</p>

        <p>By using the Website, you agree to allow us to process information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>This policy is subject to change. If our information retention or usage practices change, we will let you know by posting the Privacy Policy changes on the Website or otherwise making you aware of the changes. Your continued use of the Service following our notice of changes to this Privacy Policy, or other method of legal acceptance, means you accept such changes. Please refer to the "Effective Date" above to see when this Policy was last updated.</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy is designed to comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws, including, where relevant, the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("EU GDPR"), the UK General Data Protection Regulation ("UK GDPR," and together with the EU GDPR, the "GDPR"), and other applicable privacy laws. Under the GDPR, Proximity acts as a data Controller.</p>

        <p>Individuals located in the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, the European Economic Area, or Switzerland (collectively, for purposes of this Privacy Policy, the "EEA") may have specific rights under the GDPR in relation to their Personal Data. We are committed to respecting and, where applicable, facilitating the exercise of those rights. Individuals in other jurisdictions may also have rights under applicable local data protection laws, and we will honor such rights to the extent required by law.</p>

        <p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Data" (which may also be referred to as "Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII") means information that identifies, relates to, describes, or could reasonably be linked to an identifiable individual.</p>

        <p>If non-personal information is paired to any of your PII, we will treat the non-personal information as if it were also PII.</p>

        <h2>Why Is My Information Being Collected?</h2>
        <p>We accept and gather information to provide the Website to you. We need to collect your personal information so that we can respond to your requests for information or to be added to our email lists, enforce our Terms of Service, and otherwise provide the Website. We also collect aggregate information to help us better design the Website. We collect log information for monitoring purposes to help us to diagnose problems with our servers, administer the Website, calculate usage levels, and otherwise provide services to you.</p>

        <h2>How Do We Use the Information We Collect?</h2>
        <p>We use the personal information you provide for the purposes for which you have submitted it, including:</p>
        <p><strong>Internal Uses.</strong> We may use your PII to respond to your inquiries and to provide you with the Website and services.</p>
        <p><strong>Communicating With You About Our Services.</strong> We may use your PII to send you information that may be of interest to you.</p>
        <p><strong>Sending Administrative and Promotional Emails.</strong> We may use your PII to send you emails to: (a) confirm your account information and your other PII; (b) provide you with information regarding the Website; (c) inform you of changes to this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Service, or our other terms, conditions, or policies; or (d) provide you with information on our other services and products, or promotions related to the Website or our other services and products.</p>
