        <h2>14. Governing Law, Arbitration, Waiver of Class Action</h2>
        <p class="legal-notice">YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the state of Delaware excluding choice of law provisions without regard to any conflicts of laws that may otherwise apply. If a disagreement or dispute in any way involves the Website or these Terms and cannot be resolved between the parties with reasonable effort, the disagreement or dispute shall be resolved exclusively by confidential, binding arbitration provided by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, to be seated and held in Dover, Delaware. For purposes of this Section, "Proceeding" means any complaint, lawsuit, action, suit, claim (including a claim of a violation of applicable law), or other proceeding at law or in equity, or order or ruling, in each case by or before any governmental authority or arbitral tribunal. There shall be one (1) arbitrator. If the Parties do not agree on the selection of a single arbitrator within ten (10) days after a demand for arbitration is made, then the arbitrator will be selected by AAA from among its available professionals. Arbitration of all disputes and the outcome of the arbitration will remain confidential between the Parties except as necessary to obtain a court judgment on the award or other relief or to engage in collection of the judgment.</p>
        <p>The arbitrator may grant injunctive relief, including temporary, preliminary, permanent, and mandatory injunctive relief, in order to protect the rights of each party, but will not be limited to such relief. This provision for arbitration will not preclude a Party from seeking temporary or preliminary injunctive relief ("Provisional Relief") in a court of law while arbitration Proceedings are pending in order to protect its rights pending a final determination by the arbitrator, nor will the filing of such an action for Provisional Relief constitute waiver by a Party of its right to seek arbitration. Any Provisional Relief granted by such court will remain effective until otherwise modified by the arbitrator.</p>
        <p>You hereby acknowledge, represent and warrant that you understand that: (i) there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and, absent this mandatory provision, the parties would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial concerning Disputes; (ii) the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation; (iii) the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court; and (iv) court review of an arbitration award is limited.</p>
        <p>Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any action, suit or other legal proceeding arising out of or related to the Website, these Terms, or the transactions contemplated hereby.</p>
        <p>You agree that, unless prohibited by law, there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class, mass, batch or representative basis, and arbitration will only decide a dispute between you and us.</p>
        <p>If any part of this arbitration clause is later deemed invalid as a matter of law, then the remaining portions of this section shall remain in effect, except that in no case shall there be a class arbitration.</p>

        <h2>15. Policies for Children</h2>
        <p>The Website is not directed to or intended to be viewed by individuals under the age of 13.

Please see the Federal Trade Commission's website (www.ftc.gov) for more information.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 230 (d), as amended, we hereby notify you that parental control protections are commercially available to assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. More information on the availability of such software can be found through publicly available sources. You may wish to contact your internet service provider for more information.</p>

        <h2>16. Miscellaneous</h2>

        <h3>16.1 Waiver and Severability</h3>
        <p>No waiver of by the Company of any term or condition set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms will continue in full force and effect.</p>

        <h3>16.2 Entire Agreement</h3>
        <p>The Terms, including any documents expressly incorporated by reference, constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and the Company with respect to the Website and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Website.</p>

        <h3>16.3 Headings</h3>
        <p>Headings and titles of sections, clauses, and parts in these Terms are for convenience only. Such headings and titles shall not affect the meaning of any provisions of the Agreement.</p>

        <h3>16.4 Assignment</h3>
